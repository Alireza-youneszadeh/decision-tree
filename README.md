in this code the decision tree and random forest model has been trained on mental  disease diagnosis as classification task 
first the exploratory data analysis has been applied to data set and also Miss Forest algorithm has been used for handling missing data 
fine tuning for hyper parameters for both models considered 
the correlation matrix and pair plot has been used as feature engineering for both models
finally the confusion matrix for both models with different hyper parameters has been implemented.
